configure: error: 
  ---------------------------------------------
   The OpenSSL library that is required to
   build git2r was not found.

   Please install:
     libssl-dev    (package on e.g. Debian and Ubuntu)
     openssl-devel (package on e.g. Fedora, CentOS and RHEL)
     openssl       (Homebrew package on OS X)
   and try again.

   If the OpenSSL library is installed on
   your system but the git2r configuration
   is unable to find it, you can specify
   the include and lib path to OpenSSL with:
   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-libssl-include=INCLUDE_PATH --with-libssl-lib=LIB_PATH' git2r
  ---------------------------------------------
  
  解决：
  终端输入
  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
